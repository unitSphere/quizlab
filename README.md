# Quizlab

### Access the project live @ http://64.225.36.241
##### Feel free to test it by creating a teacher account and student accounts and logging in with them
##### As well as creating a class for them to be assigned in and generating a quiz and assigning the quiz
##### And finally, taking the quiz and viewing the results/progress

### Run App (Frontend and Backend Separately -> Better for development)

0. Install dependencies by `npm install` (Both in /backend and /frontend directories)
1. `node app.js` keep this running (execute in /backend)
2. `cd ./frontend`
3. `npm start` keep this running (execute in ./frontend)
4. Test the app through the port that you will be redirected to by frontend (e.g. localhost:3000)


### Run app (Same port for backend and frontend -> Better for production)

0. Install dependencies by `npm install` (Both in /backend and /frontend directories)
1. In /frontend execute `npm run build`
2. In /backend execute `node app.js`
3.  Test the app through the port that you will be redirected to by backend (e.g. localhost:5000)
